      <p>Basic math is nothing but the simple or basic concept related with mathematics that can be used in everyday life. Generally, counting, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are called the basic math operations. The other mathematical concept are built on top of the above 4 operations.</p>
      <p>The most ancient mathematical texts available are from Mesopotamia and Egypt (Babylonian c. 1900 BC). Many mathemeticians have become historical figures such as: Galileo, Alber Enstein, Isaac Newton, and Archimedes</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Addition">
    <header>Addition</header>
    <p>Addition means joining things together. It can also be defined as combining collections of objects together into a larger collection. It is represented by the <b>‘+’</b> sign.</p>
    <p>Numbers are also referred to as integers. Simple examples can be seen below:</p>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><code>1 + 1 = 2</code></li>
      <li><code>2 + 2 = 4</code></li>
      <li><code>10 + 12 = 22</code></li>
    <ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Subtraction">
    <header>Subtraction</header>
    <p>Subtraction means taking things away from a group. You can add a positive integer by moving to the right on number line.
      It is represented by the <b>‘- ’</b> sign.</p>
    <p>Difference : When a number is subtracted from another number, the answer is called difference.</p>    
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><code>10 - 8 = 2</code></li>
      <li><code>20 - 1 = 19</code></li>
    <ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Division">
    <header>Division</header>
    <p>Division is splitting into equal parts or groups. It is the result of "fair sharing". We use the ÷ symbol, or sometimes the / symbol to mean divide.</p>
    <p>Example: there are 12 chocolates, and 3 friends want to share them, how do they divide the chocolates?
      Answer: They should get 4 each.</p>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><code>12 ÷ 3 = 4 <b>-OR-</b> 12 / 3 = 4</code></li>
      <li><code>1 ÷ 1 = 1</code></li>
    <ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Multiplication">
    <header>Multiplication</header>
    <p>The basic idea of multiplication is repeated addition. Multiplication means Counting by number. Counting by 2's means 2, 4, 6, 8... and so on Similarly Counting by 5's means 5, 10, 15, 20...and so on.</p>
    <p>But as well as multiplying by whole numbers, we can also multiply by fractions, decimals and more. Multiplication symbols can be: 'x', '*', '()()', '()*()'</p>
    <ul class="examples">
      <li><code> 5 × 3 = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15</code></li>
      <li><code> 2 * 2 = 4</code></li>
      <li><code> (5)(1) = 5</code></li>
      <li><code> (20) * (2) = 40</code></li>
    <ul>
